# meetr
A web app that makes organising a time to meet easy. Create an event, share the link with attendees and work out the best time to meet based on everyone's availability.

Inspired by [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com), meetr aims to preserve this simplicity but provide a more aesthetic, functional and responsive UI.

You can find meetr [here](https://www.meetr.app).
